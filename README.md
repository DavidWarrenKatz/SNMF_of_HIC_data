# SNMF_of_HIC_data
This code inputs a .hic file and an positive integer n. It calculates the optimal symmetric non-negative rank r approximation of HiC contact matrix for all r less than or equal to n. The results are displayed as a r(x-axis)-by-"error of optimal-rank-r approximation"(y-axis) graph.
