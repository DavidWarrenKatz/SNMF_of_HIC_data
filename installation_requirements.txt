# installation requirements. need to run these install commands in the terminal before running the program.

# the low rank approximation is based off code from https://github.com/hiroyuki-kasai/NMFLibrary
# hic-straw is based off code from https://github.com/aidenlab/straw
# hic-straw works best on bmi cluster with python version 3.8.10



# hic-straw 1.3.1 uses "import hicstraw" and has new functions. However, when you run "python3 -m pip install hic-straw" a different 
# version of straw is downloaded. 


# if using pip, run the following installation commands in the terminal

python3 -m pip install pybind11.           //needed to install hic-straw
python3 -m pip install hic-straw
python3 -m pip install numpy
python3 -m pip install scipy
python3 -m pip install matlabengine         //need to have matlab installed on your computer first
python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib
python3 -m pip install seaborn
python3 -m pip install requests             //straw uses the requests library for support of URLs

# to run on the bmi cluster, make sure to configure the proxy settings first with the following commands

use_proxy=yes
proxy=http://username:password@bmiproxyp.chmcres.cchmc.org:80
export http_proxy=$proxy
export ftp_proxy=$proxy
export https_proxy=$proxy

# In the bmi cluster, sometimes there are permission and order of installation errors using pip. An alternative is to use the package manager conda

conda create -n hicstraw python=3.8.10.     //create a conda environment
conda activate hicstraw
conda install -c conda-forge pybind11
conda install -c jrhawley hic-straw
conda install numpy
conda install scipy
conda install -c pspuhler matlab_engine
conda install matplotlib
conda install seaborn
conda install requests

# you should now be ready to run the symmetric non-negative low rank matrix approximation code
